            <p>For the past @yearsExperience or so years I've been creating rich client applications, client services, web services, and other exciting things that help people get their work done.</p>
            <p>Most of my experience is based around Microsoft technologies; C#.NET, WinForms, <abbr title="Windows Presentation Foundation">WPF</abbr>, Windows Services, <abbr title="Windows Communication Foundation">WCF</abbr>, and SQL Server&hellip; you get the idea.</p>
            <p>I get a kick out of building software that makes people happy&hellip; and peach ice tea &ndash; I love peach ice tea. But creating simple, intuitive, and easy to use software is something I strive for.</p>
